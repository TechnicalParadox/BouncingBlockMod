# Bouncing Blocks Mod
##### This mod currently adds 5 new blocks to the game, the Bouncing Block, Padding Block, Launcher Block, Speed Block, and the Cannon Block. This allows for more possibilities in your Minecraft world! The blocks can be easily avoided by walking on the edges, but can also be covered by carpets if you want to make a trap!
